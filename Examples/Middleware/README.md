# Middleware

Middleware is provided by functions that take the request, the next handler
to call, and return the response. This allows modification of both the request
and the response. The functions are called in the order they are added.

The following projects demonstrate some middleware features:

* [Overview](./Overview/)
* [CORS](./CORS/)
* [Compression](./Compression/)

Next: [Lifecycle](../Lifecycle/) or [up](..).
